- 👋 Hi there, I’m Aaron Matharoo, a full-stack software engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in creative coding, algorthmic art, game development, and sim racing.
- 🌱 I'm currently perfecting my craft in Expo, React/React Native, Next,js, Redux, and many other JS libraries/frameworks to build professional cross-platform apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything as I have experience in Python, and C++ as well.
