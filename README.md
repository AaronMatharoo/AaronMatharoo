- 👋 Hi there, I’m Arizona, a full-stack software engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in creative coding, algorthmic art, game development, and sim racing.
- 🌱 I'm currently perfecting my craft in NextJS, utilizing ReactJS, Redux, and many other JS libraries to build professional apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything as I have some experience in Python, and C++ as well.
